Hello World !
It's Deepak here. I am a big fan of python language and I absolutely love playing around with it, writing code and doing another fun-activities.
In this tutorial I have uploaded a Code for Speech Recogintion & Wolframalpha
This is a very basic code just to start off. 
### Explaination of code !
At first Import all the necessary modules.
Then created object of speechrecognition module to initialise r.listen & r. recognise
Then use try catch and except block for error handling both the kinds of error have been initialised
Then stored text to speech input in a keyword known as text.
THen created an instance of wolframpalpha as w and created a client side to interact with their servers.
Then enter the api code. And you are good to go.
